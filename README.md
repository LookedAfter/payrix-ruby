Flow
Once you provide API `username` and `userkey` at configuration. At Every call of api it will check the authentication and login using `POST - Login` if token is expired or not found.

There are no test coverage written for gem.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'payrix-ruby', git: 'https://github.com/LookedAfter/payrix-ruby', require: 'payrix'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install payrix-ruby

## Usage
```
Payrix.configure(sandbox: true) do |config|
  config.log_level = :debug
  config.api_username = <API_USERNAME>
  config.api_userkey = <API_USERKEY>
end
```
```
b=Payrix::Resource::Businesses.new({})
if b.status(<Business Id>)
  b.response.body # Success Response Type
else
  b.response.body # Error Response Type
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
